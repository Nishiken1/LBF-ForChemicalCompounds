## Overview
This repository provides the source code and experimental data related to our research paper titled **"Efficient Compound Search Using Learned Bloom Filter."**
We propose a highly efficient chemical compound search method that integrates a Learned Bloom Filter (LBF) and minGRU to significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining high accuracy and rapid inference speed.
## Key Contributions
- Integration of minGRU into Learned Bloom Filter (LBF).
- Improved memory efficiency compared to conventional Bloom Filters (BF) and the original LBF.
- Enhanced inference performance, particularly suitable for large-scale compound databases.

## Datasets
The experiments utilized the following datasets:
### [PCBA](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1)
- The PCBA (PubChem BioAssay) dataset was downloaded from [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/), a benchmark suite for molecular machine learning.
- Each compound in PCBA is associated with multiple bioassay annotations. For this experiment, we selected a single bioassay for binary classification, specifically the one with the largest number of positive samples to ensure class balance.
- We formatted the data as CSV with two columns: smiles (the molecular structure) and active (1 for active, 0 for inactive).
**Example**:
```
smiles,active
CC(C)O,1
CCCBr,0
```
### [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- The positive examples for PFAS were downloaded from [PubChem’s classification system](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=72), under the PFAS category.
- Negative examples were randomly sampled from PubChem’s compound database, excluding known PFAS compounds.
- The PFAS dataset was created by merging these positive and negative examples.
- We formatted the data as CSV with two columns: smiles (the molecular structure) and active (1 for active, 0 for inactive).
**Example**:
```
smiles,active
C(F)(F)C(F)(F)F,1
CCCN,0
```

## Usage
### Running Experiments
A script for running multiple experiments with specified parameters is provided:
```bash
bash run_experiments.sh
```
Example content of `run_experiments.sh`:
```bash
# Experiment configurations
datasets=("PCBA")
bf_fp_probs=(0.01 0.001)
hidden_size=256
model_types=("MinGRU")
# Other experimental parameters
epochs=120
max_seq_length=50
learning_rate=0.0005
# Experiment execution loop
for dataset in "${datasets[@]}"; do
    for model_type in "${model_types[@]}"; do
        for bf_fp_prob in "${bf_fp_probs[@]}"; do
            echo "Running experiment: dataset=${dataset}, model=${model_type}, FPR=${bf_fp_prob}, hidden_size=${hidden_size}"
            python run_model.py \
                --dataset "${dataset}" \
                --epochs "${epochs}" \
                --max_seq_length "${max_seq_length}" \
                --learning_rate "${learning_rate}" \
                --bf_fp_prob "${bf_fp_prob}" \
                --hidden_size "${hidden_size}" \
                --model_type "${model_type}" \
                --bidirectional
            echo "Finished: dataset=${dataset}, model=${model_type}, FPR=${bf_fp_prob}, hidden_size=${hidden_size}"
            echo "-------------------------------------------------------"
        done
    done
done
```
## Results
The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed minGRU-based LBF significantly reduces memory usage and maintains comparable inference speed compared to traditional GRU-based methods. Detailed results and analyses are available in the `figures/` directory and in the associated publication.
